## Exploratory Data Analysis

 1. **What was the order of purchase for the age groups?**

### We can tell from this chart that customers in the age group 35-64 purchased product the most overall, while those of ages 60 and above purchased the least. 

  2. **Annual Average Revenue**

### We can be concluded that the year 2017 generated the most revenue. 2019 has the least average annual revenue.

  3. **In total, what product category made the most profit?**

### Bikes sales brought in 66.3% of the total profit in total. 

  4. **What role did the bike category's subcategories have in making it the most lucrative product?**

### It's evidential that the Road bikes subcategory brought a percentage profit of 50.7% which is alittle bit over half the total percentage profit the bike product category generated. So it is safe to say the road bikes subcategory contributed more to bike category being the most lucrative product.

  5. **What was the revenue generated by each subcategory?**

### The above chart illustrates how each subcategory made money. As expected, the road bike subcategories is taking the lead follow by the other bike subcategory.
